# Employee Messaging System - Fixed and Enhanced

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### üîß Core Problems Fixed:

1. **Missing Employee.get_all_employees() Method**
   - ‚ùå Problem: Messaging routes called `Employee.get_all_employees()` but method didn't exist
   - ‚úÖ Solution: Added static method to Employee model that calls database service

2. **Incorrect Attribute Mapping**
   - ‚ùå Problem: Code tried to access `emp.name` but Employee model uses `full_name`
   - ‚úÖ Solution: Updated messaging routes to use `emp.full_name` property

3. **Inconsistent Status Checking**
   - ‚ùå Problem: Some code checked `is_active` while Employee model uses `employment_status`
   - ‚úÖ Solution: Updated to check `employment_status == 'active'` consistently

4. **Poor Employee Search Experience**
   - ‚ùå Problem: Basic dropdown with no search functionality
   - ‚úÖ Solution: Added advanced search with real-time filtering
