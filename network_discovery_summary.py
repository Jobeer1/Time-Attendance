Network Discovery Features Summary
==================================

This document summarizes the new network discovery features added to the Terminal Management system.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
=====================

1. **Network Discovery Buttons**
   - "Discover Static IPs" - Scans a configurable IP range for devices
   - "Discover DHCP" - Shows devices from the ARP table (DHCP leases)
   - "Network Settings" - Configure IP ranges and scan parameters

2. **Network Settings Modal**
   - IP Range Start/End configuration
   - Scan timeout settings
   - Concurrent scan configuration
   - Default range: 155.235.81.1 to 155.235.81.254

3. **Device Discovery Table**
   - Shows discovered devices with IP, MAC, hostname
   - Connection status (Online/Offline)
   - Device type badges
   - Custom device names
   - Action buttons for each device

4. **Device Management**
   - Name devices with custom names
   - Set device types (Terminal, Computer, Printer, etc.)
   - Add descriptions
   - Convert discovered devices to terminals

5. **Enhanced MAC Address Lookup**
   - Fixed parsing for Windows ARP table
   - Improved error handling
   - Better validation of MAC addresses
   - Support for both individual IP lookup and bulk discovery

BACKEND ENDPOINTS:
==================

1. `/api/discover-static-devices` - POST
   - Scans IP range for devices
   - Returns list of online devices with MAC addresses

2. `/api/discover-dhcp-devices` - POST
   - Reads ARP table for DHCP devices
   - Returns devices with connection status

3. `/api/ping-device` - POST
   - Pings specific device
   - Returns online status and response time

4. `/api/save-device-name` - POST
   - Saves custom names for devices
   - Stores device type and descriptions

5. `/api/get-mac-address` - POST (Enhanced)
   - Improved MAC address lookup
   - Better error handling and validation

DATABASE FUNCTIONS:
==================

1. `save_device_name()` - Store custom device names
2. `get_device_custom_name()` - Retrieve device names
3. `get_all_device_names()` - Get all saved names
4. `delete_device_name()` - Remove device names

FRONTEND FEATURES:
==================

1. **Discovery Progress Bar**
   - Shows scan progress
   - Status messages during discovery

2. **Device Actions**
   - Name Device - Set custom name and type
   - Add as Terminal - Convert to terminal
   - Ping - Test connectivity

3. **Device Type Icons**
   - Different icons for device types
   - Color-coded status badges

4. **Real-time Status**
   - Connection status checking
   - Response time display

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
==================

1. **Configure Network Settings**
   - Click "Network Settings" button
   - Set IP range for your network
   - Adjust scan timeout and concurrent scans

2. **Discover Static IP Devices**
   - Click "Discover Static IPs"
   - System will scan the configured IP range
   - Results show in the discovered devices table

3. **Discover DHCP Devices**
   - Click "Discover DHCP"
   - System reads the ARP table
   - Shows devices that have obtained DHCP leases

4. **Name Devices**
   - Click the "Name" button (tag icon) on any device
   - Enter custom name and select device type
   - Device names are saved and persist

5. **Add Device as Terminal**
   - Click the "Add as Terminal" button (plus icon)
   - Form pre-populated with device information
   - Complete terminal configuration

6. **Check Device Status**
   - Click "Ping" button to test connectivity
   - View response time and online status

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
==================

- **Concurrent Scanning**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for fast IP range scanning
- **MAC Address Detection**: Improved parsing for Windows ARP table format
- **Hostname Resolution**: Automatic hostname lookup for discovered devices
- **Device Persistence**: Custom names and types saved in JSON database
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

TESTING:
========

The system has been tested with:
- IP range 155.235.81.1 to 155.235.81.254
- Various device types (routers, computers, printers)
- MAC address lookup for gateway (155.235.81.1)
- DHCP device discovery from ARP table

All features are now ready for use in the terminal management system.
